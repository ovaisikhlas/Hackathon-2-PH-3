# Create Backend Implementation Plan for Todo API

## Prompt
Create a detailed implementation plan for the Todo API backend that implements the 5 Basic Level features (Add, View/List, Update, Delete, Mark Complete) with secure multi-user isolation using JWT authentication and Neon PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## Context
The Todo application needs a comprehensive backend implementation plan that details how to build a robust API using FastAPI with SQLModel ORM and Neon PostgreSQL. The backend should integrate seamlessly with a Next.js frontend and Better Auth authentication system.

## Requirements

### Planning Objectives
- Outline all phases of backend development from setup to deployment
- Detail technical architecture and component responsibilities
- Specify security measures and authentication flow
- Define data models and database schema
- Plan for error handling and validation
- Include testing and documentation strategies

### Technical Architecture
- Plan FastAPI application structure with proper routing
- Design SQLModel database models with relationships
- Plan JWT authentication middleware implementation
- Design API endpoints with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Plan for database connection management
- Plan for configuration and environment management

### Security Considerations
- Plan JWT token verification process
- Plan user isolation mechanisms
- Plan input validation strategies
- Plan for protection against common vulnerabilities
- Plan authorization checks for each endpoint

### Implementation Phases
- Phase 1: Project setup and environment configuration
- Phase 2: Database models and connection layer
- Phase 3: Authentication middleware
- Phase 4: API endpoints implementation
- Phase 5: Error handling and validation
- Phase 6: Testing and documentation

### Documentation Requirements
- Plan for API documentation
- Plan for developer setup guides
- Plan for deployment instructions
- Plan for integration notes with frontend

## Expected Output
Provide a comprehensive implementation plan document that includes:
- Detailed phase-by-phase breakdown of development tasks
- Technical architecture diagram and component responsibilities
- Security implementation strategy
- Database schema and model design plan
- API endpoint specifications
- Testing strategy
- Deployment and monitoring plans
- Timeline and resource estimates
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
